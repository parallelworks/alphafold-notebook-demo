/public/apps/alphafold/alphafold.sif
Singularity launch script for Alphafold Singularity image.
flags:

./run_singularity_container.py:
  --[no]benchmark: Run multiple JAX model evaluations to obtain a timing that
    excludes the compilation time, which should be more indicative of the time
    required for inferencing many proteins.
    (default: 'false')
  --data_dir: Path to directory with supporting data: AlphaFold parameters and
    genetic and template databases. Set to the target of
    download_all_databases.sh.
  --db_preset: <full_dbs|reduced_dbs>: Choose preset MSA database configuration
    - smaller genetic database config (reduced_dbs) or full genetic database
    config (full_dbs)
    (default: 'full_dbs')
  --docker_image_name: Name of the AlphaFold Docker image.
    (default: 'alphafold')
  --docker_user: UID:GID with which to run the Docker container. The output
    directories will be owned by this user:group. By default, this is the
    current user. Valid options are: uid or uid:gid, non-numeric values are not
    recognised by Docker unless that user has been created within the container.
    (default: '108027:100002')
  --[no]enable_gpu_relax: Run relax on GPU if GPU is enabled.
    (default: 'true')
  --fasta_paths: Paths to FASTA files, each containing a prediction target that
    will be folded one after another. If a FASTA file contains multiple
    sequences, then it will be folded as a multimer. Paths should be separated
    by commas. All FASTA paths must have a unique basename as the basename is
    used to name the output directories for each prediction.
    (a comma separated list)
  --gpu_devices: Comma separated list of devices to pass to
    NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.
    (default: 'all')
  --max_template_date: Maximum template release date to consider (ISO-8601
    format: YYYY-MM-DD). Important if folding historical test sets.
  --model_preset: <monomer|monomer_casp14|monomer_ptm|multimer>: Choose preset
    model configuration - the monomer model, the monomer model with extra
    ensembling, monomer model with pTM head, or multimer model
    (default: 'monomer')
  --num_multimer_predictions_per_model: How many predictions (each with a
    different random seed) will be generated per model. E.g. if this is 2 and
    there are 5 models then there will be 10 predictions per input. Note: this
    FLAG only applies if model_preset=multimer
    (default: '5')
    (an integer)
  --output_dir: Path to a directory that will store the results.
    (default: '/tmp/alphafold')
  --[no]run_relax: Whether to run the final relaxation step on the predicted
    models. Turning relax off might result in predictions with distracting
    stereochemical violations but might help in case you are having issues with
    the relaxation stage.
    (default: 'true')
  --[no]use_gpu: Enable NVIDIA runtime to run with GPUs.
    (default: 'true')
  --[no]use_precomputed_msas: Whether to read MSAs that have been written to
    disk instead of running the MSA tools. The MSA files are looked up in the
    output directory, so it must stay the same between multiple runs that are to
    reuse the MSAs. WARNING: This will not check if the sequence, database or
    configuration have changed.
    (default: 'false')
